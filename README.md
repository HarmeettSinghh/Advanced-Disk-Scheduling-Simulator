# Advanced-Disk-Scheduling-Simulator
 A Python-based GUI application for visualizing and analyzing different disk scheduling algorithms, including FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN.

Overview-
The Advanced Disk Scheduling Simulator is a Python application designed to help users understand the working of various disk scheduling algorithms through visualization and animation. It allows users to input disk requests and the initial head position, choose a scheduling algorithm, and observe how the disk head moves while servicing requests.

The simulator supports the following disk scheduling algorithms:
✔ FCFS (First Come, First Served)
✔ SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
✔ SCAN
✔ C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
